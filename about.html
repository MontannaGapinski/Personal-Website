    <h1>About Me</h1> 
    <img src ="pwimage.jpg" alt="Photographed Portrait of Montanna Gapinski" style="width:5397px;height:3598px;"> 
    <p>I am Montanna Gapinski, a first-year student studying Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder. I am from central Minnesota and was drawn to Colorado for its strong presence in the Engineering world!</p> 
    </p>
    <p>My interest in Computer Science started from a young age when my love for video games drove me to build my own PC. From there, I embraced my problem-solving skills and hobby of playing online games and chose to apply them using CS.</p>
    </p>
    <p>In my free time, I enjoy traveling to new places and trying things I have not done before, playing video games, reading, and volunteering at the local humane society.</p>
